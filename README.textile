h1. Description:

h2. V5:

Sample app using Rails 3.1, "carrierwave":https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave and V5 of "jquery-file-upload":https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload to upload and store files on Amazon S3.

h2. V4:

The old version of the app using Rails 3 and V4 of "jquery-file-upload":https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload can be found "here":https://github.com/yortz/carrierwave_jquery_file_upload/tree/v4

The "backgrounder":https://github.com/yortz/carrierwave_jquery_file_upload/tree/backgrounder  branch delays the entire upload process to S3 thanks to "carrierwave backgrounder":https://github.com/lardawge/carrierwave_backgrounder and "delayed job":https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job

h1. Install:

* Clone or fork the github repo
* cd into app directory

<pre>
  <code>
    $: bundle install       #install required gems
    $: rake db:create:all   #create dbs
    $: rake db:migrate      #migrate db
    $: rails s              #start app
  </code>
</pre>

h1. S3:

Since this app stores files to amazon S3 you will need an "Amazon S3":http://aws.amazon.com/s3/ account, otherwise you can choose to store images on your local filesystem by editing the uploader:

<pre>
  <code>
    #app/uploaders/image_uploader.rb
    # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
      storage :file     #stores files locally
    # storage :fog      #stores files on S3
  </code>
</pre>

Amazon S3 support is made possibile by "Fog":https://github.com/geemus/fog 

You will need to tell carrierwave to use Amazons S3 by creating an initializer and providing your Amazon S3 authentication details:

<pre>
  <code>
    #config/initializers/carrierwave.rb
    
    CarrierWave.configure do |config|
      config.fog_credentials = {
        :provider               => 'AWS',                                      # required
        :aws_access_key_id      => 'amazon s3 access key',                     # required
        :aws_secret_access_key  => 'amazon s3 secret access key',              # required
        :region                 => 'us-west-1'                                 # optional, defaults to 'us-east-1'
      }
      config.fog_directory  = 'yourbucketname'                                 # required
      config.fog_host       = 'http://yourbucketname.s3.amazonaws.com/'        # optional, defaults to nil
      config.fog_public     = false                                            # optional, defaults to true
      config.fog_attributes = {'Cache-Control'=>'max-age=315576000'}           # optional, defaults to {}
    end
  </code>
</pre>

h1. Image Processing:

MiniMagick is app default for processing images; if you want to use another library, just edit the Gemfile and modify the uploader to reflect your choice:

<pre>
  <code>
    #app/uploaders/image_uploader.rb
    # Include RMagick or ImageScience support:
    # include CarrierWave::RMagick
      include CarrierWave::ImageScience
    # include CarrierWave::MiniMagick
  </code>
</pre>
